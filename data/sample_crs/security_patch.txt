SECURITY CHANGE REQUEST - Critical Vulnerability Patch

Change Request Title: Apply Critical Security Patches for OpenSSL and Node.js
Priority: HIGH  
Category: Security

Security Impact:
- CVE-2023-XXXX: OpenSSL vulnerability (CVSS Score: 8.1 - HIGH)
- CVE-2023-YYYY: Node.js vulnerability (CVSS Score: 7.5 - HIGH)
- Potential for remote code execution and data breach
- Compliance requirement for SOC2 and PCI-DSS certifications

Affected Systems:
- All production web servers (12 instances)
- API gateway servers (4 instances)  
- Load balancers (2 instances)
- Development and staging environments

Technical Implementation:
1. Update OpenSSL to version 3.0.10 (from 3.0.8)
2. Update Node.js to version 18.17.1 (from 18.16.0)
3. Rebuild and redeploy affected Docker containers
4. Update base OS packages on all servers
5. Perform security scans to verify patch effectiveness

Testing Plan:
- Vulnerability scanning before and after patches
- Application functionality testing in staging
- Performance benchmarking to ensure no regression
- SSL certificate validation and cipher suite testing

Implementation Schedule:
- Non-production environments: This weekend (Saturday 2-6 AM)
- Production environment: Next Tuesday during maintenance window (2-4 AM)
- Total estimated downtime: 30 minutes per environment

Rollback Strategy:
- Maintain previous Docker image versions for immediate rollback
- Database backup before implementation
- Monitoring alerts configured for immediate issue detection
- Automated rollback triggers if error rates exceed 1%

Compliance Requirements:
- Document patch implementation for audit trail
- Update security baseline documentation
- Notify security team and compliance officer
- Update vulnerability management dashboard

Business Justification:
Immediate patching required to maintain security posture and compliance.
Failure to patch within 30 days may result in compliance violations and potential security breach.

Risk Assessment:
- Security Risk if NOT implemented: CRITICAL
- Implementation Risk: LOW (well-tested patches, established process)
- Business Impact: MINIMAL (during maintenance window)

Approval Required:
- Security Team Lead: APPROVED
- Infrastructure Manager: PENDING
- CISO: PENDING
